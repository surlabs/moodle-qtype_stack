We then place this stack on top of a new domino a distance \\delta_n from the left of the domino. There will clearly be no toppling if</p> <p>  \\delta_n+c_n\\leq 2. </p> <p>That is to say we maintain balance if we don't displace the top stack so far that the displacement plus the distance of the centre of mass from the left pushes the centre of mass over the edge of the bottom domino - which has width 2. The new centre of mass of the whole stack of n+1 dominoes will be c_{n+1} from the left of the bottom domino where</p> <p>  c_{n+1} = \\frac{(\\delta_n+c_n)n+1}{n+1} \\mbox{ with } c_1=1. </p> <p>Using the first inequality the maximum displacement without toppling is \\delta_n=s-c_n.

One of the key advantages is that, when done correctly, it can effectively assess and give feedback to a large number of students. This frees up marking time and resources that would normally have to be spent by several tutors. Additionally, it can be frustrating for students when their tutors are not consistent in how they mark.</p> <p>The traditional form of CAA is teacher-provided answer questions. In these questions, a student makes a selection from, or interacts with, potential answers which the teacher has selected. Examples include multiple choice questions and multiple response questions. These types of questions have a number of limitations, including:</p> <ol> <li>Only finite answers are possible. The teacher can put in \"dummy responses\" for common mistakes and give feedback based on those mistakes, but it is impossible to give feedback on student errors outside the given examples.</li> <li>You can only assess lower-order skills. \"Give an example of...\" type questions are impossible.</li> <li>It encourages strategic learning, i.e. instead of solving the problem, students will think about how to \"trick the system\" and find the right answer.</li> <li>Question distortion is especially problematic in mathematics. You may ask students to integrate a complicated function, and then give a list of potential answers. Differentiating the answers to get the original expression is a much easier process, and sensible students are likely to take the easier route, which is not what we wanted the student to practice.</li> </ol> <p>The alternative is to focus on student-provided answer questions. In these questions, the student's answer contains the content. For example, a student could be asked to input an algebraic expression, like a polynomial.

However, in the case of partial  fractions where there are more than one term of the form \\log(x-a) then  we insist the student is at least consistent.  If the teacher has any \\log(|x-a|) then the student must use |...| in all of them.  If the  teacher has no \\log(|x-a|) (i.e. just things like \\log(x-a)) then the  student must have all or none. </p> <p>The Int test has various additional options.</p> <p>The question author must supply these options in the form of a list <code>[var, opt1, ...]</code>.  The first argument of this list must be the variable with respect to which integration is taking place.  </p> <p>If one of the <code>opt?</code> is exactly the token <code>NOCONST</code> then the test will condone a lack of constant of integration.  That is, if a student has missed off a constant of integration, or the answers differ by a numerical constant, then full marks will be awarded.  Weird constants (e.g. +c^2) will still be flagged up.</p> <p>The answer test architecture only passes in the answer to the test.  The question is not available at that point; however, the answer test has to infer exactly which expression, including the algebraic form, the teacher has set in the question. This includes stripping off constants of integration and constants of integration may occur in a number of ways, e.g. in logarithms. In many cases simply differentiating the teacher's answer is fine, in which case the question author need not worry.  Where this does not work, the question author will need to supply the expression from the question in the right form as an option to the answer test.  This is done simply by adding it to the list of options.</p> <pre><code>[x, x*exp(5*x+7)]\n</code></pre> <p>The test cannot cope with some situations.

With these tests it is essential that the SAns field is exactly the name of the input.  For example, if your input is <code>ans1</code> then the SAns field of the answer test must only be <code>ans1</code>. The reason for this is that Maxima changes the display of floating-point numbers to remove or add trailing zeros.  These answer tests must take the value typed at the input, not the value passed through the CAS, otherwise digits will be changed.  Further information and examples are given in the page on numbers.   This problem does not apply to the teacher's answer because we do not test whether the teacher has supplied the correct number of trailing zeros.  We only test if the student's answer is sufficiently close in numerical precision.  So, it is safe to calculate the teacher's answer field of the answer test from question variables using the CAS.

This causes a problem in assessment when we have a numerical expression, such as 100, and seek to infer the number of significant figures.

This makes it much easier to establish things like 0-1\\times i is equivalent to -i.  However, more general integer arithmatic is still not automatically included so 2\\times 3 \\neq 6.</p> <p>This test always assumes associativity and commutativity of addition and multiplication.  Essentially this test extends the <code>EqualComAss</code> test by adding in additional rules. Without assumptions of commutativity and associativity we would need all sorts of additional rules, such as x+0 \\rightarrow x, since without commutativity this would not be captured by the rule <code>zeroAdd</code>, i.e. 0+x \\rightarrow x.  Furthermore, the way <code>EqualComAss</code> deals with unary minus and division make associativity and commutativity difficult to add in their pure form.</p> <p>Each rule is a named function in Maxima, and each rule has an associated predicate function to decide if the rule is applicable at the top level of an expression.

Ultimately we only compare parse trees exactly, and so we need to order terms in sums and products (commutativity). However y-x is never ordered as -x+y.  Furthermore, -(x-y) \\neq -x+y.  We need to factor out the unary minus and ensure that the coefficient of the leading term is not negative. Factoring out is better than distributing here, since in a produce such as -(x-y)(x-z) it is not clear which term in the product the inital minus sign will end up in. Since <code>negOrd</code> is a factor command, it is incompatible with <code>negDist</code>.</p> <p>For convenience sets of rules can be specificed.  E.g. you can use the name <code>ID_TRANS</code> in place of the list <code>[zeroAdd,zeroMul,oneMul,oneDiv,onePow,idPow,zeroPow,zPow]</code> to include all of the basic identity operators.</p> <p>If you want to remove tests from a list you can use code such as <code>delete(zeroAdd, ID_TRANS)</code>.</p> <p>The test takes the student's answer and teacher's answer and repeatedly applies the rules in turn until the expressions remain the same.  The rules are designed to always shorten the expression, so the process is guranteed to terminate.  Once the expression is written in final form, the test compares the two expression trees.</p> <p>Note that we do not gurantee the simplification is mathematically correct!  E.g. if you are unlucky enough to try the rule <code>zeroPow</code> on the expression <code>0^(1-1)</code> then since <code>1-1</code> is not equal to zero (taken literally) then the rule applies and you have failed to spot a potential <code>0^0</code> error.</p> <p>If you add the rule <code>testdebug</code> then you will see both expressions in the answer note.

The goal of this code is to create reliable equivalence classes of expressions, not perform algebraic manipulation as we traditionally know it. In particular the way unary minus is transformed into multiplication with a special tag <code>UNARY_MINUS</code> is likely to cause confusion to students if an expression is manipulated using these rules and then shown to a student.

This is ok, but causes problems and is difficult to read because it mixes CAS and LaTeX.</p> <p>Hence, we would much rather have everything in one CAS object that is not simplified. The following is a single Maxima expression:</p> <pre><code> {@(aa*%e^(bb*%i))^nn@}\n</code></pre> <p>(Notice that we are using variables names with more than one character. This is good practice, as single-character variables are meant for student input. Notice also that we precede standard mathematical variables with <code>%</code> when writing in Maxima.

If your changes change the random version, then the students' previous answers will still stand, and will now most likely be \"wrong\".  Minor typographical mistakes can be fixed, but often there is nothing you can do to fix seriously bad random versions.  This is why we have the \"deploy\" system and question tests so question variants can be checked in advance....</p> <p>Modifying the question variables in a way which does not alter random versions should be fine.

The Abacus project is a STACK material sharing organisation that seeks to develop high-quality materials to be implemented following these guidelines. This document ends with additional guidelines adopted by Abacus.  This is both good practice, and will be relevant if you ever intend to join Abacus.</p> <p>The most important things are listed here. More detail is below.</p> <ol> <li>Build questions so that it is possible to detect changes in the platform. All questions must have \"question tests\", which allow unit testing of each question variant.</li> <li>Use simple correct HTML with all closing tags, avoiding explicit style of your own.</li> <li>Use only simple core LaTeX Maths environments/commands, with only <code>\\(...\\)</code> and <code>\\[...\\]</code> as the maths delimiters.</li> <li>Avoid linking to externally hosted content, such as pictures and applets.</li> <li>End Maxima commands with a semi-colon <code>;</code>.</li> <li>Add comments to your Maxima code.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Future_proof/#writing-castext","title":"Writing CASText","text":"<p>CASText is the definition of the visible parts of the question, the bit where you pose the problem to the student lay out the equations and inputs and possibly draw fancy graphics. Technically, CASText is an HTML-document fragment with inline LaTeX equations and possible logic in the form of CASText blocks.</p> <p>To ease parsing of CASText you should ensure that you are writing valid (X)HTML i.e. make sure that all the tags get closed and that you are not placing block level elements in places where they do not belong. <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;div&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code> is bad while <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> might be less bad. In the case of LaTeX using <code>\\(...\\)</code> instead of <code>$...$</code> and <code>\\[...\\]</code> instead of <code>$$...$$</code>, in Abacus <code>$</code>-delimiters for LaTeX are strictly forbidden.  (There is a simplistic auto-convert to help with a one-time conversion.)</p> <p>To ensure consistent presentation you should avoid using inline CSS styles in your CASText, as the styles of the surrounding system may change and cause conflicts. In general all styles are bad with the sole exception being <code>text-align</code> in the context of table cells. Otherwise:</p> <ul> <li>If at all possible remove all styles and the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tags related to them from the CASText. Most WYSIWYG editors have some clear formatting feature to do just that. You cannot have block level HTML elements inside a span tag, which is an inline element.</li> <li>You should not define <code>font-size</code> anywhere. If you need a heading with big text then use the <code>&lt;hX&gt;...&lt;/hX&gt;</code> tags, but not with too small or large values of X. In Abacus <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> are recommended especially in model solutions.</li> <li>Likewise all other font stylings should be left to the surrounding system but feel free to use <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> if you need and assume that the surrounding system handles them correctly.</li> <li>You can use the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag to explain how to type in answers.</li> <li>The top level of your CASText document should consist of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, or CASText block elements not of raw text. For the PRT be careful about using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags (which editors hide).  If you use the compact PRT style then STACK then puts this into span tags, and you cannot have block level HTML elements such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> inside a span tag.</li> <li>In the case of tables and images you may use a bit of styling, e.g. borders, paddings, margins, and sizes, but you should always use relative units when describing those sizes. Scale to match the current font-size or maybe to the width of the viewport or even to the maximum dimension of the display not to pixels as pixels have very different actual sizes on different screens and we cannot assume that the software displaying things will make the same scaling assumptions for them in the future.</li> <li>STACK now uses SVG, and this is preferred if you can embed this within the CASText.</li> <li>Only use supported JavaScript libraries, like JSXGraph.</li> <li>Avoid complex LaTeX constructions where you inject values into multiple places, instead try to tune Maxima LaTeX generation to meet your needs, e.g. showing working, using <code>texput</code>, or changing other features of Maxima constructs.</li> </ul> <p>If your CASText document contains scripts like JSXGraph content definitions you should ensure that if they require some external files to be evaluated you include those files with the question as links to external files will be broken at some point or the external files themselves change. In the case of JSXGraph use the <code>jsxgraph</code> CASText block which will handle the scripts at STACK level.</p> <p>All external files/links are bad! If you have images or other documents related to the question they should be included in the question. Avoid embedded frames, applets and other interactive content. To test inclusion you should be able to export the question and import it to a freshly installed raw system on a computer not connected to the internet and those questions should work. There is nothing wrong with internal files of any type, as long as they come with the question. Use of the include feature from 4.4 is also a bad thing, but you can make it less bad if the included file is present on a public server and if it is versioned so that one can link to a version that never changes.</p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Future_proof/#writing-cas-code","title":"Writing CAS code","text":"<p>The CAS code (internally keyvals and CASStrings) consists of Maxima assignment statements.

For example, will your graph  reset to display the original situation or will it at least move all movable things to the positions the student last left them? If  the student can do things that are not actually considered as part of the answer, e.g. zoom out or pan the view, do you also remember  those actions? If your graph is not used for inputting answers then this is not a major issue but if it is then you will need to solve  this issue. Basically, storing the state of the interactive graph is a key thing that the author of that graph needs to deal with.</p> <p>The basic structure of such graph logic is as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Load existing state or if not found initialise with defaults.</li> <li>Draw the graph based on that state.</li> <li>Attach listeners to everything that can be changed in the graph and store those changes into the state in those listeners.</li> </ol> <p>The simplest solution for storing state is to add a <code>string</code> type input field to the question. </p> <ol> <li>Create and hide an input with CSS, e.g. <code>&lt;p style=\"display:none\"&gt;[[input:stateStore]] [[validation:stateStore]]&lt;/p&gt;</code> (but probably not while you develop the question!)</li> <li>Make the input a \"string\" type.</li> <li>Turn off the validation and verification of the field. </li> <li>Use the extra option <code>hideanswer</code> to make sure the teacher's answer is not shown to students.</li> <li>That input field should not be connected to any PRTs.</li> <li>You can use the syntax hint feature to pass in a default value but only if that is not parametric (currently the syntax hint is not CASText: see the todo list).</li> </ol> <p>You can use that input field to store the state of the graph as a string, for example as a JSON-encoded structure. For example, assuming the name of the String input is named <code>stateStore</code>, we can store the position of a point as follows:</p> <pre><code>[[jsxgraph input-ref-stateStore=\"stateRef\"]]\n  // Note that the input-ref-X attribute above will store the element identifier of the input X in \n  // a variable named in the attribute, you can have multiple references to multiple inputs.\n\n  // Create a normal board.\n  var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard(divid, {axis: true, showCopyright: false});\n\n  // State represented as a JS-object, first define default then try loading the stored values.\n  var state = {'x':4, 'y':3};\n  var stateInput = document.getElementById(stateRef);\n  if (stateInput.value &amp;&amp; stateInput.value != '') {\n    state = JSON.parse(stateInput.value);\n  }\n\n  // Then make the graph represent the state\n  var p = board.create('point',[state['x'],state['y']]);\n\n  // And finally the most important thing, update the stored state when things change.\n  p.on('drag', function() {\n    var newState = {'x':p.X(), 'y':p.Y()};\n    // Encode the state as JSON for storage and store it\n    stateInput.value = JSON.stringify(newState);\n  });\n\n  // As a side note, you typically do not want the state storing input to be directly visible to the user\n  // although it may be handy during development to see what happens in it. You might hide it like this:\n  stateInput.style.display = 'none';\n[[/jsxgraph]]\n</code></pre> <p>Note, in the above example in <code>[[jsxgraph input-ref-stateStore=\"stateRef\"]]</code> the <code>stateStore</code> part of this tag directly relates to, and must match, the name of the input.</p> <p>In that trivial example you only have one point that you can drag around but the position of that point will be stored and it will be where  you left it when you return to the page. However, the position has been stored in a String encoded in JSON format and cannot directly be  used in STACK-side logic. The JSON format is however very handy if you create objects to store dynamically and want to represent things  of more complex nature, but in this example we could have just as well have had two separate Numeric inputs storing just the raw 'x'  and 'y' coordinates separately as raw numbers and in that case we could have used them directly in STACK's grading logic.</p> <p>If needed, JSON is not impossible to parse in STACK, but it is not easy (as in JavaScript) because Maxima has no map  data-structures and is not object oriented. In any case, the JSON string generated in the previous example would look like this:</p> <pre><code>stateStore:\"{\\\"x\\\":4,\\\"y\\\":3}\";\n</code></pre> <p>To parse and manipulate it you can use STACK's custom JSON parsing functions:</p> <pre><code>tmp:stackjson_parse(stateStore); /* This returns a STACK-map: [\"stack_map\", [\"x\", 4], [\"y\", 3]] */\nx:stackmap_get(tmp,\"x\");         /* 4 */\ny:stackmap_get(tmp,\"y\");         /* 3 */\ntmp:stackmap_set(tmp,\"z\",x*y);   /* [\"stack_map\", [\"x\", 4], [\"y\", 3], [\"z\", 12]] */\njson:stackjson_stringify(tmp);   /* \"{\\\"x\\\":4,\\\"y\\\":3,\\\"z\\\":12}\" */\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/JSXGraph/#convenience-tools-for-building-graphs","title":"Convenience tools for building graphs","text":"<p>The previous section covered the general case of storing the state of the graph and acting on it. Typically, you only need to handle a few points and maybe some sliders and for this task we provide ready-made functions that bind those primitive objects to STACK input fields. As these binding functions only deal with singular sliders and points they will also use simpler forms of passing around the values.</p> <p>The example in the previous section about moving the point around and storing the points position as an JSON object can be redone with the convenience functions in much simpler form. The only major differences being that the value is stored as a raw list of float values, and the input field should not be of the String type instead we can store it as Algebraic input and directly access the values, just make sure you allow float values in that input.</p> <pre><code>[[jsxgraph input-ref-stateStore=\"stateRef\"]]\n  // Create a board like normal.\n  var board = JXG.JSXGraph.initBoard(divid, {axis: true, showCopyright: false});\n\n  // Create a point, its initial position will be the default position if no state is present.\n  var p = board.create('point', [4, 3]);\n\n  // Bind it to the input and state stored in it.\n  stack_jxg.bind_point(stateRef, p);\n\n  // As a side note, you typically do not want the state storing input to be directly visible to the user\n  // although it may be handy during development to see what happens in it. You might hide it like this:\n  var stateInput = document.getElementById(stateRef);\n  stateInput.style.display = 'none';\n[[/jsxgraph]]\n</code></pre> <p>For sliders you use the function <code>stack_jxg.bind_slider(inputRef, slider)</code> and it stores the sliders value as a raw float. Sliders will however require that you call <code>board.update()</code> after binding to them, otherwise the graph may not display the stored state after reload.</p> <p>You should check the sample questions about JSXGraph binding for examples of these functions in action.</p> <p>Starting from version 4.3 there are three functions for dealing with pairs of points. Basically, if you want to represent vectors, lines or circles or anything that can be defined with just two points. <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_dual(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will store the positions of the points into a single input as a list of lists, <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_relative(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will also generate a list but in it the second point is represented relative to the first, and finally <code>stack_jxg.bind_point_direction(inputRef, point1, point2)</code> will provide the first point as coordinates and the second point as an angle and distance from the first.</p> <p>Starting from 4.4 there is only one new bind function <code>stack_jxg.bind_list_of(inputRef, list)</code> which takes a list of points and/or sliders and stores it into a single input. It only works if he size or order of the list does not change during page loads, however the list can change its shape for variants of the question. The primary use target for this are the vertices of polygons, but one can probably come up with something else as well, it does work as a quick and dirty way of storing the whole graph state if the graph can be defined just by points and sliders.</p> <p>There are also two new functions realted to dealing with groups of objects and matching inputs. For situations where the answer consists of multiple elements and it is possible that not all get moved one can use <code>stack_jxg.define_group(list)</code> which takes a list of points and/or sliders and makes it so that touching any one of them will trigger them all to be considered as touched and thus generates inputs. There is also <code>stack_jxg.starts_moved(object)</code> which takes a point or a slider and marks it as touched from the start, this may be of use if the graph is an optional part and the actual grading depends of other parts or if one wants to use PRT feedback as a way for describing the status of the graph and needs the objects to be transferred onto the CAS side without interaction from the student.</p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/JSXGraph/#convenience-tools-for-generating-lists-of-values","title":"Convenience tools for generating lists of values.","text":"<p>If you want to output a list of values without Maxima's normal bracket symbols you can use</p> <pre><code>stack_disp_comma_separate([a,b,sin(pi)]);\n</code></pre> <p>This function turns a list into a string representation of its arguments, without braces.

Either give the numerical tolerance as a number, or a list of options.  The numerical tolerance must be the first element of the options list.</li> <li>By default the test is case-insensitive.  If you include the atom <code>CASE</code> in the list of options then the matching is case sensitive, potentially increasing the Levenshtein distance between strings.  E.g. use answer test option <code>[0.9, CASE]</code> for a case-senstive test with a tolerance of 0.9.</li> <li>By default this test consolidates whitespace, e.g. replaces tab and newline characters with a single space, trims whitespace from each end and separates with at most one space character.  If you include the atom <code>WHITESPACE</code> in the list of options then whitesapace is not consolidated.</li> </ol> <p>The current answer test provides feedback indicating which of the allow strings was most similar.  The test does not provide feedback indicating which of the deny strings was most similar, but if you can find a use-case which needs deny based feedback please contact the developers and we will add an option.</p> <p>The answernote records the most similar allow string, the most similar deny string and the corresoding tolerance values.  It is likley that a teacher will need to examine students' answers in the fist use cycle and fine tune the <code>allow</code>, <code>deny</code> and tolerance values (perhaps with a regrade) to reach an acceptable level of test reliability: the use of the tolerance means this test is not as objective as some other STACK assessments.</p> <p>It is likely this test will benefit from a wide range of text pre-processing options prior to the test being executed, e.g. using functions from Maxima's stringproc library.  For example</p> <ul> <li>remove (ignore) accents and diacritical marks</li> </ul> <p>At this point we do not propose to add these as options to the test itself as the pre-processing can be done in the feedback variables as required.

An early design decision was to restrict each of the possible answers to be a CAS expression.  In particular, we decided NOT to make each possible answer CASText.

A fundamental design principal of STACK is that the student's answer should be a mathematical expression, and this input type is no exception.  </p> <p>In situations where there is a significant difference between the optional <code>display</code> and the <code>value</code> which would be confusing, the only current option is to turn off validation feedback.  After all, this should not be needed anyway with this input type.  In the example above when a student is asked to choose the right method the <code>value</code> could be an integer and the display is some kind of string.  </p> <p>An example which includes the <code>display</code> option is</p> <pre><code>tacp:[[A, false, \"A.

In this situation you can't really randomize the letters used easily.  (Not impossible with some cunning code, but a lot of work....)</p> <p>If you choose to use an integer, and randomly suffle the answers then the validation feedback would be confusing, since an integer (which might be shuffled) has no correspondence to the choices selected.  This behaviour is a design decision and not a bug! It may change in the future if there is sufficient demand, but it requires a significant change in STACK's internals to have parallel \"real answer\" and \"indicated answer\". Such a change might have other unintended and confusing consequences.</p> <p>Normally we don't permit duplicate values in the values of the teacher's answer.  If the input type receives duplicate values STACK will throw an error.  This probably arises from poor randomization.  However it may be needed.  If duplicate entries are permitted use the display option to create unique value keys with the same display. This behaviour is a design decision may change in the future.</p> <p>When STACK displays the \"teacher's answer\", e.g. after a quiz is due, this will be constructed from the <code>display</code> fields corresponding to those elements for which <code>correct</code> is <code>true</code>.  I.e. the \"teacher's answer\" will be a list of things which the student could actually select.  Whether the student is able to select more than one, or if more than one is actually included, is not checked.  The teacher must indicate at least one choice as <code>true</code>.  </p> <p>If you need \"none of these\" you must include this as an explicit option, and not rely on the student not checking any boxes in the checkbox type.  Indeed, it would be impossible to distinguish the active selection of \"none of these\" from a passive failure to respond to the question.</p> <p>If one of the responses is x=1 \\mbox{ or } x=2 then it is probably best to use <code>nounor</code> which is commutative and associative.

Because the tree is only traversed when all inputs are valid, the score is only generated for a valid attempt.</p> <p>If a score is generated it is based only on the current values of the inputs.  This means that it is not based on either (1) previous values of the inputs, or (2) the number of previous attempts.  (Requests have been made to enable attempt number to be available, but this has not been implemented  yet.)</p> <p>If a score is generated then a penalty is also generated. The penalty system is designed to encourage students to make repeated attempts in a formative setting.  For example, a student is asked to find   \\int x^2, \\mathrm{d}x.  </p> <p>Attempt 1:   x^3/3.

This is multiplied by the \"Question value\" set in the potential response tree.  These are summed across all potential response trees.</p> <p>In this example, some colleagues would prefer to give partial credit for missing a constant of integration rather than zero marks and a penalty.  In a formative setting, where students have an opportunity to have another attempt, the penalty system has been found to be an effective way to encourage students to have another attempt and to read the feedback.  In an examination, where no feedback is available and so further attempts are not made, different choices need to be made and partial credit would be more appropriate than a zero mark.</p> <ul> <li>The penalty is given a default value in the question.  This is a mandatory field; the default for STACK is 0.1.  </li> <li>Penalties are cumulative, but the student will be given the maximum possible mark.  I.e. while they accumulate penalties they are never worse off by repeatedly attempting the question.  In particular, if the student in the above example makes another attempt and scores 0 they will retain their mark of 0.9.  This is to encourage students to have another go in a formative setting.  STACK generates a list of penalty adjusted scores for each attempt, and takes the maximum. </li> <li>The penalty can be assigned a different value in the nodes of the potential response tree.

Templates are essentially a way for handling repetition when <code>[[foreach]]</code> does not easily work or when inline CASText based function solutions are inconvenient. While inline CASText is often better it might not work as well as overridable templates when working with libraries.</p> <p>The template block has two parameters, the first being a name which should be a valid name for a function and the second being the mode parameter that controls the blocks behaviour and is of use especially for library builders. There are three different ways for using this block:</p> <ol> <li>To define a templates value for a given name one simply wraps that value in this block with that name. <code>[[template name=\"foobar\"]]Whatever is {@whatever@}[[/template]]</code>. This will not output anything and can also be done in inline CASText either in the question-variables to effect the whole question or in feedback-variables to effect PRTs.</li> <li>To output that template, one simply uses the empty block form <code>[[template name=\"foobar\"/]]</code> which will output whatever has been defined as that templates value or a warning about the template not been defined. One can add a mode parameter <code>mode=\"ignore missing\"</code> to not see that warning. Typically, one will use the <code>[[define/]]</code> block to change the values used within the template.</li> <li>For library makers the most common operation mode is the <code>mode=\"default\"</code> where the contents of the block are used if no overriding definition can be found. The default value will not define a default template and this intentional, if a template is to be shared then it needs to be defined at a global level where it always gets evaluated while default templates tend to be sensible to use even in conditionally evaluated contexts. Basically, if your library has any CASText that could benefit from being overridable you simply give it a name and wrap it with <code>[[template name=\"libarary_xyz\" mode=\"default\"]]...[[/template]]</code> and then maybe document somewhere that this name has this default where these injectable variables have these roles so that people may replace the wording and structure and still use the same values.</li> </ol> <p>Note in the background templates are just functions with CASText values. You can do the same with inline CASText and more importantly building your own functions allows you to use arguments for them and thus makes repetition with varying parameters simpler. For templates no arguments exist, for them the values come from the context where they get placed in, and must therefore be controlled though other means.</p>"},{"location":"en/Authoring/Question_blocks/#blocks-that-exist-but-should-not-be-used","title":"Blocks that exist but should not be used","text":"<p>There are other blocks that have roles inside the system and that transfer information required for the operation of the system.

This is because there is some genuine ambiguity in whether  is a single object or the sum of two parts.  In mathematics we use this ambiguity to our advantage, but in online assesment we need to be more precise.  There are also issues of unary minus, e.g. not displaying 1 + (-2)\\mathrm{i}.

In particular, this function makes use of Maxima's <code>realpart</code> and <code>imagpart</code> function to split up <code>ex</code> into real and imaginary parts.  To do this it must assume <code>simp:true</code>, and so the real and imaginary part will be simplified.  For example, <code>display_complex(1+2*%i/sqrt(2))</code> is displayed as 1+\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{i}.  If you really want 1+\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,\\mathrm{i} then you will need to use the non-simplifying alternative below.  This function respects normal conventions, e.g. when <code>realpart</code> returns zero this function will not print 0+2\\,\\mathrm{i}, it just prints 2\\,\\mathrm{i}, etc.  </li> <li><code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> assumes <code>a</code> is the real part and <code>b</code> is the imaginary part (no checking is done).  This function (mostly) does not simplify its arguments.

Use the atom <code>null</code> if you do not want to print a zero for the real part, or print one times the imaginary part.  <code>disp_complex(null, 2)</code> will appear as 2\\,\\mathrm{i} and <code>disp_complex(null, null)</code> will appear as just \\mathrm{i}.  Think of <code>null</code> as a non-printable unit (additive or multiplicative).</li> </ol> <p>There is one exception.  In order to pull out a unary minus to the front, <code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> will simplify <code>b</code> if <code>b</code> is not a number and it contains a unary minus.

The expression <code>disp_complex(a, b)</code> is an \"inert form\", which is only used to fine-tune the display.  This function is not actually defined and so Maxima always returns it unevaluated.

Some common observations about this form of reasoning are</p> <ol> <li>Students often use no logical connectives between lines.</li> <li>Students ignore the natural domain of an expression, e.g. in \\frac{1}{x} the value x=0 is excluded from the domain of definition.</li> <li>Operations which do not result in equivalence are often used, e.g. squaring both sides of an equation.</li> </ol> <p>This input type mirrors current common practice and does not expect students to indicate either logic or domains. The input type itself will give students feedback on these issues.</p> <p>Note that students must use correct propositional logic connectives <code>or</code> and <code>and</code>. E.g. their answer must be something correct such as <code>x=1 or x=2</code>, not something sloppy like <code>x=1 or 2</code> or <code>x=1,2</code>. It certainly can't be something wrong such as <code>x=1 and x=2</code> which is often seen in written answers!</p> <p>Note that students may not take square roots of both sides of an equation.  This will be rejected because it is not equivalent!  Similarly, students may not cancel terms from both sides which may be zero.  As we require equivalence, students may not multiply either.  This will probably not correspond to students' expectations, and may take a bit of getting used to.</p> <p>But should students really use logical connectives?  Yes, I (CJS) believe they should but to require this from the input type now would be too big a step for students and their teachers. Students are already being expected to use connectives such as <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> correctly.  The input type uses these connectives and in the future options may be added to this input type which require students to be explicit about logical connectives, especially when we add support for implication in addition to equivalence.

Atoms are either an integer number, float, string or a name.  You can use the predicate <code>atom()</code> to decide if its argument is an atom.  Expressions have an operator and a list of arguments. Note that the underscore symbol is not an operator.  Thus <code>a_1</code> is an atom in maxima. Hence, the atoms <code>a1</code> and <code>a_1</code> are not considered to be algebraically equivalent.  If you would like to consolidate subscripts in students' input see the documentation on extra options.  Also note that since the underscore is not an operator, an expression such as <code>(a_b)_c</code> is not valid Maxima syntax, but <code>a_b_c</code> is a valid name for an atom.</p> <p>You can change the TeX output for an atom with Maxima's <code>texput</code> command.  E.g. <code>texput(blob, \"\\\\diamond\")</code> will display the atom <code>blob</code> as .  If you place <code>texput</code> commands in the question variables, this affects the display everywhere in the question including the inputs.  E.g. if a student types in <code>blob</code> then the validation feedback should say something like \"your last answer was:  \\diamond \".</p> <p>Display with subscripts is a subtle and potentially confusing issue because subscript notation in mathematics has many different uses.  For example,</p> <ol> <li>Subscripts denote a function of the natural numbers, e.g. when defining terms in a sequence a_1, a_2, a_3.  That is the subscript denotes function application.  a_n = a(n).</li> <li>Subscripts denote differentiation, e.g.  x_t  is the derivative of x  with respect to t.</li> <li>Subscripts denote coordinates in a vector, in  \\vec{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\cdots, v_n)  .</li> </ol> <p>There are many other possible uses for subscripts, especially in other subjects e.g. in physics or actuarial studies.</p> <p>Because Maxima considers subscripted expressions to be atoms, the default TeX output of an atom <code>V_alpha</code> from Maxima is  {\\it V\\_alpha}  (literally <code>{\\it V\\_alpha}</code>) and not  V_{\\alpha}  as a user might expect.  For this reason STACK intercepts and redefines how atoms with the underscore are displayed.  In particular STACK (but not core Maxima) takes an atom <code>A_B</code>, applies the <code>tex()</code> command to <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> separately and concatenates the result using subscripts.  For example, if you define</p> <pre><code>texput(A, \"{\\\\mathcal A}\");\ntexput(B, \"\\\\diamond\");\n</code></pre> <p>then <code>A_B</code> is now displayed as {{{\\mathcal A}}_{\\diamond}}.</p> <p>Below are some examples.</p> Maxima code Maxima's <code>tex()</code> command (raw output and displayed) STACK  (raw output and displayed) <code>A_B</code> <code>{\\it A\\_B}</code> {\\it A\\_B} <code>{{A}_{B}}</code>  {{A}_{B}}  <code>A[1]</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1} <code>{A_{1}}</code>  {A_{1}}  <code>A1</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}  <code>{A_{1}}</code>  {A_{1}}  <code>A_1</code> <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}  <code>{A_{1}}</code>  {A_{1}}  <code>A_x1</code> <code>{\\it A\\_x}_{1}</code>  {\\it A\\_x}_{1}  <code>{{A}_{x_{1}}}</code>  {{A}_{x_1}}  <code>A_alpha</code> <code>{\\it A\\_alpha}</code>  {\\it A\\_alpha} <code>{{A}_{\\alpha}}</code>  {{A}_{\\alpha}}  <code>A_B_C</code> <code>{\\it A\\_B\\_C}</code>  {\\it A\\_B\\_C}  <code>{{{A}_{B}}_{C}}</code>  {A_B}_C  <code>x_t(1)</code> <code>{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)</code>  {\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)  <code>{{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)}</code>  {{\\it x\\_t}\\left(1\\right)}  <p>Notes</p> <ol> <li>in the above examples three different expressions (atoms <code>A1</code>, <code>A_1</code> and the expression <code>A[1]</code>) generate the same tex code <code>A_{1}</code>  A_{1}, and so are indistinguishable at the display level.</li> <li>The expression <code>x_t(1)</code> refers to the function <code>x_t</code> which is not an atom, and hence STACK's logic for displaying atoms with underscores does not apply (by design).  If you want to display a function name including a subscript you can explicitly use, e.g. <code>texput(x_t, \"x_t\");</code> to control the display, this is just not done automatically.</li> </ol> <p>One situation where this design is not satisfactory is when you want to use both of the atoms <code>F</code> and <code>F_1</code> but with different display. For example <code>F</code> should display as {\\mathcal F} but <code>F_1</code> should display as  F_1 .  Such a situation is not hard to imagine, as it is often considered good style to have things like  F_1 \\in {\\mathcal F}.  The above design always splits up the atom <code>F_1</code> into <code>F</code> and <code>1</code>, so that the atom <code>F_1</code> will display as  {\\mathcal F}_1.  (This is actually what you normally expect, especially with the Greek letter subscripts.)  To avoid this problem the logic which splits up atoms containing an underscore checks the texput properties list. If an entry has been made for a specific atom then STACK's display logic uses the entry, and does not split an atom over the underscore.  In the above example, use the following texput commands.</p> <pre><code>texput(F, \"{\\\\mathcal F}\");\ntexput(F_1, \"{F_1}\");\n</code></pre> <p>With this code <code>F</code> displays as {\\mathcal F}, the atom <code>F_1</code> displays as  F_1 , and every subscript will display with calligraphic, e.g. <code>F_alpha</code> displays as {\\mathcal F}_{\\alpha}.  There is no way to code the reverse logic, i.e. define a special display only for the unique atom <code>F</code>.</p> <p>Note that the scientific units code redefines and then assumes that symbols represent units.  E.g. <code>F</code> is assumed to represent Farad, and all units are typeset in Roman type, e.g.  \\mathrm{F}  rather than the normal  F . This is typically the right thing to do, but it does restrict the number of letters which can be used for variable names in a particular question.  To overcome this problem you will have to redefine some atoms with texput.  For example,</p> <pre><code>stack_unit_si_declare(true);\ntexput(F_a, \"F_a\");\n</code></pre> <p>will display the atom <code>F_a</code> as F_a, i.e. not in Roman.  If you <code>texput(F, \"F\")</code> the symbol <code>F</code> is no longer written in Roman, as you would expect from units.  This may be sensible if Farad could not possibly appear in context, but students might type a range of subscripted atoms involving <code>F</code>.</p> <p>The use of texput is global to a question. There is no way to display a particular atom differently in different places (except perhaps in the feedback variables, which is currently untested: assume texput is global).</p> <p>How would you generate the tex like  A_{1,2} ?  STACK's <code>sequence</code> command (see below) does output its arguments separated by a comma, so <code>sequence(1,2)</code> is displayed as  {1,2} , however the Maxima command <code>A_sequence(1,2)</code> refers to the function <code>A_sequence</code>, (since the underscore is not an operator).  Hence STACK's logic for splitting up atoms containing the underscore does not apply.  (In any case, even if the display logic did split up function names we would still have the issue of binding power to sort out, i.e. do we have the atom with parts <code>A</code> and <code>sequence(1,2)</code> or the function named <code>A</code> and <code>sequence</code>?)  To create an output like  A_{1,2}  you have no option but to work at the level of display.  Teachers can create an inert function which displays using subscripts.</p> <pre><code>texsub(a,b)\n</code></pre> <p>is typeset as {a}_{b} i.e. <code>{a}_{b}</code> in LaTeX.  For example,</p> <ul> <li><code>texsub(A, sequence(1,2))</code> will display as {{A}_{1, 2}},</li> <li>with simplification off, <code>texsub(F,1-2)</code> will be displayed as {F}_{1-2}.</li> </ul> <p>Note that the process of converting <code>theta_07</code> into the intermediate <code>texsub</code> form internally results in the <code>texsub(theta,7)</code> which removes the leading zero.  This is a known issue, for which a work around is to directly use <code>texput(theta_07, \"{{\\\\theta}_{07}}\")</code> or <code>texsub(theta,\"07\")</code>.  The second option does not produce optimal LaTeX, since it uses TeX <code>mbox</code>, e.g. <code>{{\\theta}_{\\mbox{07}}}</code>.</p>"},{"location":"en/CAS/Maxima/#Types_of_object","title":"Types of object","text":"<p>Maxima is a very weakly typed language.

While nested <code>disp_select</code> are possible (and will dispaly multiple underlines: another reason for having underline) this particular function stops once <code>p1</code> is true.  You will need to build nested display by hand.</p> <p>For example, to select all the integers in an expression you can use the predicate <code>integerp</code> and <code>select(integerp, 1+x+0.5*x^2)</code> gives \\color{red}{\\underline{1}}+x+0.5\\cdot x^{\\color{red}{\\underline{2}}}.</p> <p>It is possible to use any of the existing predicate functions, or to define your own function in the question variables.</p> <p>The function <code>select_apply(f1, ex)</code> traverses the expression and when it encounters the <code>disp_select</code> function it applied the function <code>f1</code> to that sub-tree of the expression.

This sub-tree is not selected by this predicate.</li> <li><code>p2</code> displays as {\\left(1-1\\right)\\cdot x^2+0+1}.

Notice the third, optional boolean, argument to <code>select_apply</code> in <code>p3</code>.

This is  however something that should be thought of in larger scale and this  document present one way of trying to deal with the complexity of  the whole issue.</p>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Future_input_processing/#the-problem","title":"The problem","text":"<p>Various inputs have various rules about what kind of input is being  expected. The rules vary from forbidding floats and requiring the responses type to match the type of the teacher's answer, to actually fixing the input syntax in the form of insertion of missing stars and conversion of spaces to stars. In addition to this some inputs may even declare additional  syntax e.g. the way the line by line reasoning works. There are also some  complex CAS-evaluation based requirements that some inputs may ask for  like representing the answer in lowest terms when working with fractions.</p> <p>Those are the kinds of things inputs declare for student input processing and most of those are not trivial and have interactions with certain other features we have in our validation chain.</p> <p>The CAS-statement processing pipeline also includes some amount of syntactic candy in the form logarithms of various bases being representted in  complex ways from the statements, for example <code>log_x+y(z) =&gt; lg(z, x+y)</code>. In addition to that kind of syntax expansions there also exists various  rules that check for typical errors like <code>sin^2(x)</code> which will need to be dealt in the correct place of the processing pipeline, typically before  input level insert stars rules get applied. That latter example will break  down quite badly if someone applies a rule that splits all multiletter  variable names to multiplications of single letter names, before we identify  that <code>sin</code> in this case is actually a badly written function-call that needs to be specially pointted out to the student.</p> <p>The current pre 4.3 situation is complex because most of such rules are mixed in various processing steps and much of the logic that the inputs themselves should handle is actually built into the complex casstring-class making it  difficult to easily separate features and/or place new features into the mix.</p>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Future_input_processing/#one-way-of-looking-at-the-casstring-processing","title":"One way of looking at the casstring processing","text":"<p>For teacher/code sourced casstrings the logic is relatively simple:</p> <ol> <li>Direct parsing of the statement without any corrective pre-processing.      Generates an AST style representation of the statement.</li> <li>That AST will be piped through syntactic candy filtters to allow use     of various features like the logarithm logic.</li> <li>In the end that AST will be explored for security issues.</li> </ol> <p>For the pipeline of student sourced things is more complex:</p> <ol> <li>The parsing will go through a corrective parser that tries to add      missing stars into places where they would make the input syntactically      valid. In addition to this the parsing may apply additional syntax specific     to the input type. Those inserted stars will be tagged in the resulting      AST.</li> <li>Syntactic candy filters will be applied to the AST.</li> <li>Early phase feature detection will be applied to the AST, without      modification of the AST, <code>sin^2(x)</code> detection and similar pattern matching.     This detection may lead to processing marking a whole subtree of the AST     as invalid so that insert stars of other remaining steps do not modify it     further.</li> <li>Additional star insertion, based on the input's preferences, will be applied     to the AST.

Is such exist error messages will      be generated and they will mark those stars.</li> <li>Security check. If fails things stop here. Note that part of the security     check rules are based on options to the input and part to the the whole      question.</li> <li>Simple feature checks, things that the input may require and that can be      easily checked from the AST:<ul> <li>if floats are forbidden then the AST should have none.</li> <li>if we have some form of type constraint then the AST should fit it.</li> <li>if significant figures or decimal places matter they should be checked     from the AST.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Complex feature checks, things like lowest terms need to be sent to CAS to     be checked only after these (if they exist) have been checked can we say     wether the input is valid. These checks should not be tied to the AST they     should happen using it but through separate CAS-statements</li> </ol> <p>One way to look at this is that inputs should have means of doing much of the low level parsing themselves, and there must be ways of them to select ready made AST-filters to be added to the process. The other point from this is that casstrings should not do parsing themselves they should just receive ready ASTs and the parsing and insert stars logic are not part of validation of the casstring the only validation the casstring does is the validation of security, insert stars and other tricks are part of input validation. In some sense this makes casstrings just the containers of the AST and probably the results of its evaluation, it however makes sense for those containers to contain the most important bit of all i.e. the security checking. It also makes sense to use the casstring object as a wrapper of the AST and the store of the error messages, which leads to the conclusion that casstrings get created from the results of step 2 in those processes and need to have interfaces into which various AST filtters get pushed into to update the AST before the final validation.</p> <p>It also makes sense to collect step 8 related statements from multiple inputs  together for validation and that those statements also include whatever is  needed to represent the validity to the student. Likewise step 7 probably bases its behaviour on the teachers answer or other parameters of the input and should also be collected from multiple inputs for single pass validation.</p>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Future_input_processing/#class-structure","title":"Class structure","text":"<p>Based on the presented we need the following classes with at least the  following methods, stack_cas_cassecurity is the very same it is in 4.3:</p> <pre><code>class stack_cas_casstring {\n\n    /**\n     * Executes an AST filter on the AST defining this casstring.\n     */\n    public function filter_ast(stack_cas_astfilter $filter) {}\n\n    /**\n     * Validation is now based only on the security settings and the current AST.\n     */\n    public function validate(string $security_level, stack_cas_cassecurity $rules): bool {}\n\n}\n\nclass stack_cas_astfilter {\n\n    /**\n     * Does whatever it needs to the AST and may append to the errors or notes\n     * might receive stack_cas_casstring directly, but better to keep these \n     * separate.\n     */\n    public function filter(MP_Node $ast, array &amp;$errors, array &amp;$answernotes): MP_Node {}\n\n}\n\n</code></pre> <p>The idea here is that once the code is in this form whenever one wants to build syntactic candy or error checks one builds a new stack_cas_astfilter and if it is something central it will probably go to step 2 of the processing otherwise it will be a part of the student input pipeline and under the control of inputs. In any case one can write tests for it separate from everything else, but one will need to also define its place in the processing order and test  the whole chain as some other filter might appear in that chain and eat up the things. To keep the order in order I would recommend that the files  containing filter code are prefixed with something like '012_' and that we  leave plenty of empty room if at all possible in that range, for future filters to be plugged into the sequence.

However, the difference between <code>-%pi</code> and <code>-1*%pi</code> is seriouly problematic.  Indeed, this kind of distinction is exactly what some answer tests, e.g. <code>EqualComAss</code> and <code>CasEqual</code>, are designed to establish.  These tests will not work with a mix of simplified and unsimplified expressions, even if to the user they look completely identical!</p> <p>The solution to this problem is to \"rinse\" away any maxima internal simplification by using the Maxima <code>string</code> function to return the expression to the top level which a user would expect to type.  This process corresponds to what happend in older versions of Maxima in which expressions were routinely passed between Maxima and PHP, with the string representation being used.</p> <p>Some expressions (lists, matrices) are passed by reference in Maxima, so even if the teacher's answer is created without simplification in the first instance, when it is evaluated by the answer tests there is a risk of it becoming simplified when it is later compared by an answer test function.</p>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/","title":"Building the parser","text":""},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/#install-node","title":"Install node","text":"<p>We need to use node:</p> <pre><code>apt-get install node npm\n</code></pre> <p>Inside <code>stack/stack/maximaparser</code> (or anywhere else), and not as root</p> <pre><code>npm install pegjs \nnpm install phpegjs ts-pegjs\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/#compile-the-parser","title":"Compile the parser","text":"<p>To compile the parser</p> <pre><code>node gen.js\n</code></pre> <p>This should return <code>null null null</code> and create new parsers for STACK.</p>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/#adding-rules-to-the-parser","title":"Adding rules to the parser","text":"<p>Identical changes need to be made in both</p> <ol> <li><code>stack/maximaparser/MP_classes.php</code></li> <li><code>stack/maximaparser/autogen/parser-grammar.pegjs</code></li> </ol>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/#naming-parser-rules","title":"Naming parser rules","text":"<p>We give each parser rule a name, numbered in the approximate appropriate order in which they need to be applied.</p> <ul> <li>0-10 the mandatory stars for \"f(x)(y) =&gt; f(x)*(y)\" and syntactical candy like the logarithms</li> <li>10-20 rules forbidding certain usages.</li> <li>20-30 identification of typical syntax mistakes like \"sin^2(x)\".</li> <li>30-40 rules forbidding certain usages, like calling functions at all.</li> <li>40-50 various rules adding stars, insert stars in function calls and split variables and whatnot.</li> <li>60-70 rules forbidding certain usages, e.g. forbid floats.</li> <li>80-90 logic to check for things that have been done and deciding whether what was done was ok i.e. stars were inserted but not allowed in \"syntax=true\".</li> </ul>"},{"location":"en/Developer/Parser/#debugging-the-parser-rules","title":"Debugging the parser rules","text":"<pre><code>echo \"\\n\" . $ast-&gt;debugPrint($ast-&gt;toString() .
